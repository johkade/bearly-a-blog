# css units and what they actually mean

React Native has revolutionized the world of mobile app development by allowing developers to build cross-platform applications using JavaScript. One of the key tools that has contributed to the success and rapid adoption of React Native is Expo.

## What is React Native?

React Native is a powerful framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build native mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. It allows for code sharing across platforms, reducing development time and effort while still delivering a native-like user experience.

## The Role of Expo

Expo is an open-source `platform` and set of tools built around React Native that provides additional capabilities and simplifies the development workflow. It acts as a development environment, making it easier to kickstart a React Native project and provides a range of features that can enhance the development process. Here are some key roles that [Expo](https://expo.dev) plays:

```css
div[data-blur="blur-small"] {
  composes: commonBlur;
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  filter: blur(0);
}
div[data-blur="blur-default"] {
  composes: commonBlur;
  backdrop-filter: blur(32px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(32px);
  filter: blur(0);
}
```

## Conclusion

React Native, combined with Expo, provides developers with a powerful toolkit to build cross-platform mobile applications. Expo simplifies the development process, offering an easy setup, development and testing tools, access to native APIs, and over-the-air updates. It empowers developers to create high-quality and feature-rich apps efficiently, ultimately contributing to the growth and popularity of the React Native ecosystem.

So whether you are a beginner starting your first React Native project or an experienced developer looking to speed up your development process, Expo can be a valuable asset in your React Native journey.

Happy coding!
